= 04 - Solution Strategy

== Basic principles
. Everything is written as code!
. Every deployment etc. is done from a pipeline!
. Everything is validated by linters / scanners!
. Everything runs in Docker! This includes build artifacts as well as every tool which is used for development.

== Project Structure
The project sorts its source files into several folders:

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Directory |Description
|`docs` |Project documentation in Asciidoc
|`src/main/go` |The actual source code of the jiracli application
|`src/main/postman` |Postman collections containing webservice calls
|`src/main/runtime` |Docker Compose configurations
|`src/main/utils` |Utility modules which are used from other scripts (e.g. link:https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli[cobra-cli] or xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/util/bash-modules/go-wrapper-sh.adoc[the wrapper script to run Go in Docker]).
|===

== Code Styleguide
The source code of this application follows the link:https://go.dev/doc/effective_go[Effective Go] guide from the Go Website.

// .Contents
// A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

// * technology decisions
// * decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
// * decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
// * relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

// .Motivation
// These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

// .Form
// Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

// Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
// based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
// Refer to details in the following sections.

// .Further Information
// See https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy] in the arc42 documentation.
