Create a Jira index in the foreground after starting Jira.

== Overview

When starting the Jira instance that acts as the test environment the Jira
instance is provided with a h2db and is populated with a license, users and projects so
there is no need  re-run the setup wizard all the time.

The only issue is, that there is no data visible  in the UI after starting up because
there is no (or at least no uncorrupted) index. A new index must be created in the foreground.
To avoid manual interaction, this is done in a dedicated container running this script. This
script calls the Jira API to trigger a re-index.

IMPORTANT: This script is intended to run inside a `jira-indexer` container from Docker
Compose. Don't run this script directly!

=== Script Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.
