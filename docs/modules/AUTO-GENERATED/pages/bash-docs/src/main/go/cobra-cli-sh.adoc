Use cobra-cli to generate some code blocks.

== Overview

The script runs the `cobra-cli` in Docker to generate some source code blocks
like adding new cli-commands.

Cobra provides its own program (`+link:https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli[cobra-cli]+`) that
will create your application and add any commands you want. It's the easiest way to incorporate
Cobra into your application.

=== Script Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.

=== Script Example

[source, bash]

----
./cobra-cli.sh
----

=== cobra-cli

Wrapper function to encapsulate `cobra-cli` in a docker container.
The current working directory is mounted into the container and selected as working
directory so that all file are available to `cobra-cli`. Paths are preserved.
The container runs with the current user.

==== Example

[,bash]
----
cobra-cli --help
----

==== Arguments

* *...* (String): The `cobra-cli` commands (1-n arguments) - $1 is mandatory

==== Exit codes

* *8*: If param with `cobra-cli` command is missing

=== init

The `cobra-cli init [app]` command will create your initial application code for
you. It is a very powerful application that will populate your program with the right structure
so you can immediately enjoy all the benefits of Cobra. It can also apply the license you specify
to your application.

=== add_command

Once a cobra application is initialized you can continue to use the Cobra generator
to add additional commands to your application. The command to do this is `cobra-cli add`.
